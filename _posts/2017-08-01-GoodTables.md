GoodTables is a Python project and an online tool to check for structural problems and ensure that data fits a specific schema. Applications range from simple validation checks on CSV files, to integration with a larger ETL pipeline. The development of Good Tables has been driven by a real-world pain point: monitoring and validating government spending data in the United Kingdom . A brief overview of this use case can demonstrate the value proposition of Good Tables.
